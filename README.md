### Simple PyGame pong game with a clever computer player


Bug warning!
This is a very quick creation that I made from a very random idea and completely out of boredom,
hopefully you still find it interesting!

I would make this calculate further for smarter gameplay but I made the ball velocity random so it cannot think that far.
Maybe in the future I'll make an actual algorithm for the velocity that it can predict.
